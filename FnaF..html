	<h2>The Aftons - Information </h2>
	<img src="https://i.redd.it/88vd5edpt3h21.jpg" height="300" width="400" class="down"><br>
	<p class="abc">There are supposedly 5 Aftons
	<p class="abc">-William Afton
	<p class="abc">-Clara Afton
	<p class="abc">-Michael Afton
	<p class="abc">-Elizabeth Afton
	<p class="abc">-Chris Afton
	<p class="abc">The story starts when Elizabeth and,then Chris were born.Their parents,William and Clara would take great care of them..unlike how they took care of Michael.Michael eventually started getting jealous of Chris.
	<p class="abc">He then takes his friends' advice and starts bullying Chris with his Foxy mask,and eventually had gotten the name of 'Foxy bully'.He now goes a few steps further..
	<p class="abc">On chris' birthday at Freddy fazbear's pizzeria, Michael and his friends decided to play a prank.They decided to put Chris' head into Fredbear's mouth.They carried him and put his head into fredbear's mouth.Chris crying , Michael and his friends laughing.
	<p class="abc">Chris' frontal lobe had been bitten by fredbear.Micheal..crying in shock.Everyone went silent..
	<p class="abc">Chris went into a coma, and had died of a heart attack.Michael on the other hand , regretted everything and had went into depression....
	<p class="abc">Soon , Elizabeth ran away from home..She went MISSING..
	<p class="abc">She had found a particular location, namely The Sister Location which her father had build (all animatronics,pizzerias etc were built by William afton).William warned her not to go near any animatronic, especially Circus baby, her favorite.
	<p class="abc">She was stubborn and went near it becuase she thought it was beautiful.Circus baby had an ice-cream in her hand by the time elizabeth went near her.Just as elizabeth was taking her hand out to get the ice-cream....The claw in Circus baby pulled her into her,that killed her..Which was apparently a 'System Malfunction' .She then possessed Circus Baby.
	<p class="abc">Soon finding out that elizabeth went missing , William went insane and killed 6 children.He had stuffed their bodies into animatronics so that they could not fully "die"
	<p class="abc">After discussing that he had did so with Clara,They started fighting and argueing.He got really angry and had scared Clara with a knife.Clara started crying and drove off in her car.Due to what happened,she had drove down a cliff and died.She had then somehow possessed Ballora.
	<p class="abc">After William found out she died, He regretted killing and went back to free the children's souls..The children took this as an oppurtunity to get revenge.They started chasing afton.William started running,he then came across a SpringBonnie suit.He went into it hoping that the children would go back.Little did he know,It had Springlocks.The springlocks gave him deep cuts everywhere and alot of blood loss caused him to die.Soon possessing SpringBonnie,He had also caught a virus in his head, it was named as glitchtrap.
	<p class="abc">Micheal , started working as a NightGuard at every location.He had then ended up at SL (sister Location).His fate was written there..On Night 5 of the shift.HandUnit had tranmitted his name to Eggs Benedict instead of Micheal.
	<p class="abc">All the SL animatronics wanted to escape SL,Namely Ennard.He had taken Circus Baby's voicebox and had guided Michael to the 'Scooping Room'.But Michael had not Known that It.Was.ENNARD...He looked around..then the scooper actiavted and had..got scooped.All his organs were scopped out and he had turned into a walking corpse.Ennard then climbed inside him and went out of SL.
	<br>
	<p class="abc">Its done..Is this the end of the Aftons?
	<p class="abc">Is there more to this story than written here?<br><br>
